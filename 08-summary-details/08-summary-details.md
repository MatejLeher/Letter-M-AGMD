First thing important to do good thesis is to defing goal of your job when choosing the topic. In my case the main goal is to create new promotional campaign focused on social media. It is important because this event is loosing popularity and visibility. With that I will also analyze what social media should Festival Fantazie use in addition to regular ones (Facebook, Instagram) and last inportant thin in my mind was to define more suitable subtitle. Which right now is Festival of popular culture. That is very general statement and does not really tell what is this events theme.

Festival Fantazie is mainly about fiction and games. This is how some articles and media reffer to it. When you see this original logo it might remind you of some videogame logo like World of Warcraft or League of Legends. Definetly not pop music or other branches of popular culture.

I was studying history and progress of popular culture and stumbled upon interesting issue of subculture. Many genres of differet types of culture began as minor thing but later became popular due to media and technological innovations. This creates problem of things and genres that are part of popular culture but their fandom shares more aspects with defitnition of subculture

Marvel Movies vs. Comic Books

--------

<img src="./images/06.jpg" alt="06.jpg" width="1000"/>

Game of Thrones series vs. Game of Thrones Cosplayers

--------

<img src="./images/07.jpg" alt="07.jpg" width="1000"/>

League of Legends vs. Gamers

--------

Board Games vs. Dungeons and Dragons

But is it right to call Festival Fantazie pop culture event then?

--------

<img src="./images/10.jpg" alt="10.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/11.jpg" alt="11.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/12.jpg" alt="12.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/13.jpg" alt="13.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/14.jpg" alt="14.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/15.jpg" alt="15.jpg" width="1000"/>

It began more as meeting of fans of fiction, fantasy, literature, movies, games, etc.

---------

<img src="./images/16.jpg" alt="16.jpg" width="1000"/>

Then I began with research of other events and their visual style and communication on social media.

--------

<img src="./images/17.jpg" alt="17.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/18.jpg" alt="18.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/19.jpg" alt="19.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/20.jpg" alt="20.jpg" width="1000"/>

**Comic conventions** take lot of inspiration from comic book art stylization. Color splashes or dottet patterns. It often is more retro and somtimes even childish which does not fit to Festival Fantazie with its older audience. And it also does not combign everything that this event has to offer.

-----------

<img src="./images/21.jpg" alt="21.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/22.jpg" alt="22.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/23.jpg" alt="23.jpg" width="1000"/>

**Gaming conventions and esport events** are more modern. Graphic design is usualy 3D. For example Dreamhack shares dottet pattern with comic conventions but does it in three dimentional style. But in comarison with Festival Fantazie it is too "high quality" and might give different expectations to the viewer.

----------

<img src="./images/25.jpg" alt="25.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/26.jpg" alt="26.jpg" width="1000"/>

**Asian conventions** are handled usualy very artisticaly and differently than western conventions. For that reason I will not take inspiration from them

-----------

<img src="./images/28.jpg" alt="28.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/29.jpg" alt="29.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/30.jpg" alt="30.jpg" width="1000"/>

PAX is best example of well handled visual style. It combines very well comic patterns and modern graphic style. It has also good and clear structure of their different events (PAX ONLINE, PAX WEST, etc. Social media are colorful and catchy.

-----------

<img src="./images/31.jpg" alt="31.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/32.jpg" alt="32.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/35.jpg" alt="35.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/33.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>

Current visual style of Festival Fantazie is kinda all over the place. The are using different versions of logo on different places. They don't have clear division of their sub events. Their campaign on social media was really bland. Iconic thing that didn't continue last two years were ilustrated posters for each year. So it really needs update

----------

<img src="./images/36.jpg" alt="36.jpg" width="1000"/>

In my redesign of logo I chose to keep two main colors of original design and made it more 3D with changing the double FF lines

---------

<img src="./images/38.jpg" alt="35.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/39.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/40.jpg" alt="35.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/41.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/42.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>

The dotted pattern will be created for social media post background in different color variations.

---------

<img src="./images/43.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/44.jpg" alt="35.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/45.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/46.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>

Then it will be used similar to campaing in 26th and 27th each but more colorful and inviting. Content will be released in set of three on instagram and facebook carousel wich is popular thrend right now

------

<img src="./images/47.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/48.jpg" alt="35.jpg" width="1000"/>

Reddit is first new social media that I want to use in campaign and that is because it is best to create fandom and let community around Festival Fantazie to create content and discussion rather than promotion by organizers.

-------

<img src="./images/49.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/50.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>

Next one is discord and this is platform which is very useful to handle comunication during the festival. 

------

<img src="./images/51.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>

That is one of the big inconviniences and problems of the festival which has very complicated program placed in 4 different buildings and outdoors during 8-10 days. Discord can have different communication channels for each point in program and also differentiate the organizer from  participants.

<img src="./images/53.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>
<img src="./images/54.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>

--------

<img src="./images/55.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="1000"/>

Last new platform is Twitch and this is mainly to stream the content of the Festival Fantazie. This is main social media that vast majority of fans of videogames knows and therefore it is best place to promote. Also lot of influencers which might help with promotion of the event are on this platform.

--------

<img src="./images/FF2.jpg" alt="33.jpg" width="500"/>

All social media need emoticons. Lot of them are right now allowing doing custom emojis and especialy on Twitch it is part of the culture. I wanted to make emoticons that can be used as emojis but also as navigation signs or on merchendise.

Tje last past of presentation is ilustrated poster which is representing every year of festival. My version was this time made in mind of new campaign and features of the event. Dark blue sky is representing the background, white stars evoke the dottet style which I was describing and logo is placed on the shining fulll moon signalizing new redesign of it. Mountains, forest and lake is hyperstylisation of the Chotěboř region (Iron moutains, water tanks and ponds and nature). The lower half of poster is smeared and fogy representing the main fiction genres (horror, fantasy) and unidentified object (Sci-fi) has hidden refference to the title used by residents of Chotěboř to describe fans and participants of the festival ("UFO-ni" = aliens)
