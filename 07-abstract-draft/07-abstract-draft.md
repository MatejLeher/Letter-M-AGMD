# The Abstract Draft

Bachelor thesis is focused on creating a new visual style and campaign for Festival Fantazie in Chotěboř, one of the biggest festivals of popular culture in The Czech Republic. This event, that once dominated in middle and east Europe, is becoming more and more forgotten. The SFK Avalon club which organizes this event did not manage to keep up with the times due to bad communication on social media and basically runs it the same tracks and lives mainly of its loyal fans that know about it already. Main focus of this thesis is to turn around this trend and come up with a visual style of communication mainly on social media.

Theoretical part contains description of influences of popular culture in the world of media and marketing and it also discusses its connotations with more or less subcultural fanbase of individual cultural branches. It also includes research and analysis of visual style and communication of foreign events with similar themes.  Last but not least it analyzes social media which would be beneficial to include in the marketing strategy of the SFK Avalon club.
 
Practical part is focused on showing the design of the new visual style for the campaign which aims to target old and new audiences and reach the growth of popularity of Festival Fantazie. It describes the mindflow and justification of steps during the creation process and final form of graphical materials.
