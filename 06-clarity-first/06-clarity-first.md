/ In other contries these tzpes of events have huge sponsorships and are way to promote new movies or TV shows. In case of Czech Republic and Festival Fantazie there is almost no sponsorship and it is way harder to get attention of media.

/ Althoughthe event is self proclaimed as festival of popculture it is not really great term. Mostly it is known for science fiction and fantasy and it would be better for communicating it.
